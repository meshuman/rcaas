  answer:
    'Digital heritage documentation creates an accurate, measurable 3D record of a monument or historic site, so its form, proportions and condition are kept even if the site changes. RCAAS Technology documents temples, stupas, palaces and historic towns across Nepal, and turns those records into experiences that let people everywhere explore them.',
