For drone aerial mapping, ground resolution (GSD) is typically sub-centimeter, with absolute real-world georeferencing anchored by survey-grade GNSS control points. We agree the accuracy your project needs during planning and tell you honestly if it can be achieved. Every project includes verification against independent check points.',

    question: 'Is the data tied to real-world coordinates?',

  {
    question: 'Does scanning damage buildings or monuments?',
    answer:
      'No. Terrestrial laser scanning and drone aerial capture are completely contactless (non-destructive). Our sensors emit eye-safe Class 1 laser pulses or capture passive aerial imagery. Nothing touches the monument, making it safe for delicate timber carvings, ancient terracotta, and fragile structures.',

                A digital twin is an accurate, measurable 3D copy of a real building, site or landscape. RCAAS Technology captures places across Nepal with advanced laser and aerial scanning, then delivers point clouds, drawings, maps and 3D models that architects, engineers, conservators and planners can work from with confidence.
